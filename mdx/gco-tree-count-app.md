# GCO's tree count with user activity

![The App](https://res.cloudinary.com/dow1abm8v/image/upload/v1750774514/myImages/u1aqamedciiryakr0xhb.png "The App")

#### I built an innovative full-stack application using Next.js, TypeScript, NextAuth, and PostgreSQL to empower GreenChild Organization (GCO), a nonprofit dedicated to sustainability and community. GCO plants a tree for every newborn child, symbolizing hope for a greener future. My app streamlines this mission by enabling employees to manage critical data with ease and precision.

## Key Features:

![User Accounts & Permissions](https://res.cloudinary.com/dow1abm8v/image/upload/v1750775813/myImages/jpv8ybm7oi6lpnit31gr.png "User Accounts & Permissions")

#### User Accounts & Permissions: Employees can create secure accounts, while admins have full control over access and permissions, ensuring data security and role-based functionality.

![Tree & Child Data Management](https://res.cloudinary.com/dow1abm8v/image/upload/v1750775973/myImages/pqcy8d3e974qib13hnvl.png "Tree & Child Data Management")

#### Tree & Child Data Management: The app tracks detailed information, including 30 types of child-related data (e.g., birth records), tree species, the number of trees planted per child, and their precise locations using GPS coordinates.


![Tree Auditing System](https://res.cloudinary.com/dow1abm8v/image/upload/v1750776069/myImages/cjr907qeq8qdgzmh99of.png "Tree Auditing System")

#### Tree Auditing System: Every tree is audited at 6, 9, 12, and 24 months to ensure healthy growth. Only trees with mismatched location data are flagged for review, streamlining the audit process.

![Performance Tracking](https://res.cloudinary.com/dow1abm8v/image/upload/v1750776237/myImages/d16r68ughhons9wsbdfk.png "Performance Tracking")

#### Performance Tracking: Admins can view real-time analytics, such as how many trees each employee has logged per month and the percentage of completed data entries per user, fostering accountability.

![Dynamic Reporting](https://res.cloudinary.com/dow1abm8v/image/upload/v1750776345/myImages/tikxo8g2rstjphl9xtfa.png "Dynamic Reporting")

#### Dynamic Reporting: Admins can generate insightful reports to monitor GCO’s impact, from tree-planting progress to environmental outcomes, all at the click of a button.

### This app isn’t just a tool—it’s a bridge between GCO’s mission and real-world impact, helping plant the seeds for a sustainable tomorrow, one child and one tree at a time.

## Building this full-stack app for GCO taught me to weave Next.js, TypeScript, NextAuth, and PostgreSQL into a seamless, mission-driven tool. I mastered crafting secure user systems, managing complex data like tree audits and child records, and delivering real-time analytics with flair. From tackling GPS-based tracking to streamlining admin reports, I learned to code with purpose, turning sustainability goals into digital reality!
